# HTML, CSS, JS Project ðŸ“½

## **Requirement**
- [x] Must be fully responsive
- [x] Use Tailwind Framework
- [x] Use Youtube video

## **Technologies**
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JS

## **Project Context**
Given this was my first time working with tailwind css, here is some explaination on the certain choices I've made

- I write my styles in css or sass. So some of the main difficulty I've faced with the tailwind css library is the repetion of code. This was my firs time working with tailwind. I haven't looked to it in details to minimize project turn over time but all that class code repeating itself on certain tags could easily be done by plain css, sass or possibly other tailwind solution to make it cleaner and more readable.

- I haven't spent much time configuring the library to the certain hex colors that were used in the figma design, instead I've used similar looking tailwind css classes to mimik the design.

- Although `flex` was used in the figma design, I have made the choice to built the footer using `grid`. I find the `grid` system to be more responsive for a block seprated contents like footers.

- Profile pictures are replaced by default profile icons.

- I wrote some minor JavaScript to handle toggle clicks for the navigation on smaller devices. It's located at the bottom of `index.html`.

- The majority of the time was spent on making the web page responsive and to create a similar layout. Given more time, and familarity with tailwind I'm pretty confindent that I can build it to the ideal requirement.
