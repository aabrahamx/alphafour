## **Project Context**
Given this was my first time working with tailwind css, here is some explaination on the certain choices I've made

- Some of the main difficulty I've faced with the tailwind css library is the repetion of code. I haven't looked to it in details to minimize project turn over time but all that class code reapting itself on certain tags could easily be done by plain css, sass or possibly other tailwind css solution that I am not aware of at this point.

- I haven't spent the time to configure the library to the certain hex colors that were used in the figma design, instead I've used similar looking tailwind css classes to mimik the design.

- Also, I have made the choice to built the footer using grid although it said flex on the figma design. I found the grid system to be more responsive for a block seprated contents like footers.

- profile pictures are replaced by default icons

- The majority of the time was spent on making the web page responsive and to create a similar layout. Given more time, and familarity with tailwind I'm pretty confindent that I can build it to the ideal requirement.


- top-border instead of div
- footer overflow
- frame names are id 
- icons colors 
- grid for footer
- for ease of use I used outside sources for images
- not stressing a lot of time on the colors
- Mention that your code is not clean, mention that this is your first time using tailwind css and still hadn't figure out reusabity of tailwind css for time saving purposes but you have a functional website per speecification
